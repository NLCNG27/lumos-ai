The U.S. passport card is not valid for international air travel.   Unlike the U.S. passport book, the U.S. passport card is valid only for entry at land border crossings and sea ports of entry when traveling from Canada, Mexico, the Cari b bean, and Bermuda. The maximum number of letters provided for your given name (first and middle) on the U.S. passport card is 24 characters. If both your given names are more  than 24 characters, you must shorten one of your given names you list on item #1 on page 1 of 2. Both the passport book and card are U.S. passports. They reflect the bearer’s identity and nationality, and they are subject to existing passport laws and regulations. U.S. passports are only issued to U.S. citizens or non-citizen U.S. nationals.  Passport service fees are established by law and regulation (see 22 U.S.C. 214, 22 C.F.R 22.1, and 22 C.F.R. 51.50-56), and are collected at the time you apply for the passport service. If we fail to receive full payment of the applicable fees (for example,   if   your check is returned for any reason or you dispute a passport fee charge to your credit card), the U.S. Department of State will take action to collect the delinquent fees from you under 22 C.F.R. Part 34 and the Federal Claims Collection Standards (see 31 C.F.R. Parts 900-904). In accordance with the Debt Collection Improvement Act (Pub.L. 104-134), if the fees remain unpaid after 180 days and no repayment arrangements have been made, we will refer the debt to the U.S. Department of Treasury for collection. Debt collection procedures used by the U.S. Department of Treasury may include referral of the debt to private collection agencies, reporting of the debt to credit bureaus, garnishment of private wages, and administrative offset of the debt by reducing, or withholding eligible federal payments (e.g., tax refunds, Social Security payments, federal retirement, etc.) by the amount of your debt, including any interest penalties or other costs incurred. In addition, non-payment of passport fees may result in the invalidation of your passport. An invalidated passport cannot be used for travel. If you send us a check, it will be converted into an electronic funds transfer (EFT). This means we will copy your check and use the account information on it to electronically debit your account for the amount of the check. The debit from your account will usually occur within 24 hours and will be shown on your regular account statement. You will not rec ei ve your original check back. We will destroy your original check, but we will keep the copy of it. If the EFT cannot be processed for technical reasons, you authorize us to process the copy in place of your original check. If the EFT cannot be completed because of insufficient funds, we may try to make the transfer up to two times, and we will charge you a one-time, non-refundable fee of $25, which we will also collect by EFT.  HOW FEES ARE ESTABLISHED AND PROCESSED PROTECT YOURSELF AGAINST IDENTITY THEFT - REPORT YOUR PASSPORT LOST OR STOLEN  A United States citizen or non-citizen national may not normally have more than one valid or potentially valid U.S. passport book or more than one valid or potentially valid U.S. passport card at a time. Therefore, when a valid or potentially valid U.S. passport book or U.S. passport card cannot be presented with a new application, you must submit form DS-64, Statement Regarding a Lost or Stolen U.S. Passport. Your statement must detail why the previous U.S. passport book or card cannot be presented. The information you provide regarding your lost or stolen U.S. passport book or card will be placed into our Consular Lost or Stolen Passport System. This system is designed to prevent the misuse of your lost or stolen U.S. passport book or card. Anyone using the passport book or card that was reported lost or stolen may be detained upon entry into the United States.   If you find the U.S. passport book or card that was reported lost or stolen, report it as found, and submit it for cancellation. It has been invalidated. You may not use that passport book or card for travel.  For more information about how to report a lost or stolen U.S. passport book or card, please call the National Passport Information Center (NPIC) at 1-877-487-2778 (TDD/TTY: 1-888-874-7793) or visit travel.state.gov/loststolen.  Instruction Page 3 of 4 NOTICE TO APPLICANTS FOR NO-FEE REGULAR, SERVICE, OFFICIAL OR DIPLOMATIC PASSPORTS  You may use this application if you meet all of the provisions listed; however, you must consult your sponsoring agency for instructions on proper routing procedures before forwarding this application. Your completed passport will be released to your sponsoring agency for forwarding to you.  INFORMATION ON HOW YOU RECEIVE YOUR PASSPORT(S)  Separate mailings : You may receive your newly issued U.S. passport book and/or card and your citizenship evidence/original documents in two separate mailings. If you are applying for both a U.S. passport book and card, you may receive three separate mailings: one with your returned citizenship evidence/original documents; one with your newly issued U.S. passport book; and one with your newly issued U.S. passport card. Photocopies will not be returned.  Passport number : Each newly issued passport book and/or card will have a different passport number than your previous one.  “In   c are   o f” : If you do not live at the address listed in the “mailing address” section of this application, put the name of the person who does live at that address and write “In Care Of” in item #8 on page 1 of 2.
